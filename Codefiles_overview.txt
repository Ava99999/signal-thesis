Example 2 - (1D) structured example of block signals with a bandlimiting generative model, modified by Tristan
Example 3 locally sup - (1D) new attempt at locally supported measurement masks, but now with Fx in Cp,q rather than x
Example 4 2D defect experiments - using the 2D code from ptygenography again, implementation of different noise types
Example 5 linear generative model (1D) - setting up the simplest example of a generative model, using just a random matrix
Locally supported measurements - attempts (not working) to implement generative model that maps to Cp,q, using bandlimited masks
Locally supported measurements condensed - the file above with less notes, sent to Tristan
Low frequency signal example - only functions that create a simple example of a 10 and 20 Hz sigmo√Ød signal


Github PtyGenography
1D example trials - out of use file of threshold and bandlimit
1D signals threshold and bandlimit - attempts at bandlimit that were structurally improved by Tristan (into Example 2)
ptygenography code - original Github code that I don't dare to modify further (only added Gaussian masks)
